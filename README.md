# ðŸ“‚ Smart File Saver
Originated for my personal use and curiosity to build something usefull using tkinter and python!

A simple but smart **Python desktop app** (built with \`tkinter\`) that saves a copy of a \`.txt\` file into a date-organized folder structure â€” **with Portuguese month names** â€” and keeps a preview right in the app.  
It remembers your last selected file and destination folder, so you can easily use it daily.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ“… **Automatic date-based organization** with folders like:
```

destination_folder/  
	2025/  
		Agosto/  
			2025.08.10\_myfile.txt

```
- ðŸ—‚ **Portuguese month names** instead of numbers  
- ðŸ–¼ **Preview pane** to see the fileâ€™s contents before saving  
- ðŸ’¾ **Remembers your last file & folder** between runs  
- ðŸ›¡ **Keeps file metadata** with \`shutil.copy2\`  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Simple GUI** for picking the destination folder and file

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoseVColino/Daily_Entry_Saver.git
cd Daily_Entry_Saver
```
2. **Install Python if you haven't** (3.8+ recommended)
3. **Run the app**
```bash
python app.py
```

## ðŸ›  Dependencies

Only Pythonâ€™s **standard library** is used:

- `tkinter` â€“ GUI elements & dialogs
- `pathlib` â€“ path handling
- `datetime` â€“ date formatting
- `shutil` â€“ file copying
- `os` â€“ screen and path utilities

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. You pick a **destination folder**
2. You pick a `.txt` file
3. The app:
	- Reads todayâ€™s **year, month (Portuguese), day**
	- Creates the folder path inside your chosen destination if needed
	- Saves a copy of the file with the format `YYYY.MM.DD_filename.txt`
4. The last used file & folder are saved to `previous_file.txt` so they can be reloaded next time
